Overview
This analysis aims to help Alphabet Soup determine whether or not applicants for funding will be successful based on previuos data around investments. With a deep learned model, Alphabet Soup should be able to make an informed decision about future investors with similar criteria.

Results
The “IS_SUCCESSFUL” designation was considered the target for the model.

I selected 80 and 30 neurons and 1 layers initially to match the starter code output.
Target model performance was not achieved, although the model did improve from 72.3% accuracy to 72.4% accuracy.

Features for this model included but wasnt limited to affiliation, classification, use Case, organization and Status.
Given that 75% accuracy was not achieved no-new model has been saved.
